# WordamentSolver
A solver for the Wordament game

This WPF application designed using C# and XAML, helps us to play Microsoft Wordament by simply entering the letters in the array and clicking on a letter button to display the list of combinations.

This has a built in file system for referance to a dictionary of words grouped based on the first character(in seperate files) to optimize access, since we use sequential access file systems are more efficient than database systems.
This also gives a visual sequence of how to get the word by following the pattern.

Have fun playing Wordament!! :)
